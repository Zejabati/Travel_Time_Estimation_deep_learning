# Travel_Time_Estimation_deep_learning

This repository houses a comprehensive framework designed to accurately predict travel times using GPS data. The model consists of three key sections: Attribute Embedding, Spatiotemporal Learning, and Multitask Learning. We have developed a novel structure for the Spatiotemporal Learning component using CNN, Bi-LSTM, TCN algorithms, effectively capturing spatial and temporal dependencies from GPS data. This enhanced approach improves the predictive capabilities of our model, leading to more precise travel time estimates.

Our enhanced Travel Time Prediction Model with Spatial-Temporal Learning is built upon the following original work:
Paper: When Will You Arrive_ Estimating Travel Time Based on Deep Neural Networks? by Wang, D., Zhang, J., Cao, W., Li, J., & Zheng, Y. (2018)
